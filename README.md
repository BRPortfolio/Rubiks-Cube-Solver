# Rubiks-Cube-Solver
A Rubik's Cube solver for the console, written in VB.NET.
In the form of a 2D net of a (Rubik's) Cube you can enter the colours (the same as on a standard Rubik's Cube, except there is no orange in the VB.NET console - so it has been replaced with magenta) using the WASD keys (see instructions in project).
There is also a scramble feature if you just want to test it.
The cube will then be solved in around 250 (max 300) moves.
Each move's action performed will be displayed along side a visual representation of how the cube net should look.
